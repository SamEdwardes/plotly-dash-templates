# Plotl.y Dash Templates

## Background

Dash is a tool created by Plot.ly to create interactive dashboards in Python and R.

[https://plot.ly/dash/](https://plot.ly/dash/)

The [Dash Gallery](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/) has many good examples, but these can be confusing to implement sometimes becuase of the complex charts.

This repo provides barbone outlines that you can populate with your own plots.

## How to Contribute
