# Plot.ly Dash Templates

## Background

Dash is a tool created by Plot.ly to create interactive dashboards in Python and R.

[https://plot.ly/dash/](https://plot.ly/dash/)

The [Dash Gallery](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/) has many good examples, but these can be confusing to implement sometimes becuase of the complex charts.

This repo provides barbone outlines that you can populate with your own plots. The focus of this repo is to provide an outline of sctucture, as opposed to an outline of how to do cool plots (which the [Dash Gallery](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/)) is better for.

## How to Contribute
